# Machine learning game

This project will make you play against your computer. The computer will tell you something and the goal is to make the same thing with your hand.

## How is this working ?

We trained a model using three hand gestures via and implemented the model in our code. Next to that, we used **ml5js** that will allow the gestures recognition. 

*Please note that if you want to play the game, you'll need a webcam.*
